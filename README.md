Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.

As a Software Developer at Kohn Pedersen Fox, I handle the development of three applications for the architectural staff. My career started with architecture, but a role as a BIM lead, specializing in 3D modeling, led to a chance to collaborate with developers at that same firm. Their work was so interesting that I dedicated my next couple of years to an intensive coding school journey that resulted in a full-fledged career transition to software development.

I recently co-created and built Tailslide, an open-source feature flag framework for easier code deployment with automated failure protection. Tailslide was built using Node.js, Express, NATs JetStream, PostgreSQL, Redis Timeseries Database, and React/Redux.
